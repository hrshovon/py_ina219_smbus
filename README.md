# py_ina219_smbus
A simple to use smbus based library for INA219 high side power monitoring chip. It does not depend on any other library so it should work on virtually any single board computer having I2C.
Just put in the same directory where you are running your program. That should do the trick.
I did not write it from scratch. Rather its a collection of existing codes refactored to my liking.
